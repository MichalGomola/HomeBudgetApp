# HomeBudgetApp
My Java App for managing home budget

As by now I'm still using Excel sheets to manage my home budget, so I got the idea I will make my own app to manage it.
App will be created with Java and Spring Framework. For front end I will mostly use Thymeleaf and Bootstrap.

In the app there will be features like managing budget, adding income (like salary, bonuses and other), adding costs (taxes, insurance, health, food, etc.),
showing monthly budget balance, preparing charts showing different costs in total and later even more.

The app will be connected to H2 or SQL database.
At the beggining I will probably use some kind of file repository to test all the features.

This will be my first standalone project after Java + Spring bootcamp
I will update README together with the app
